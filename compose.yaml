# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  db:
    image: scylladb/scylla
  nats:
    image: nats:2.10-scratch
    command: "--http_port 8222 -js --store_dir /data/jetstream --config /config/config.conf"
    ports:
      - "8222:8222"
      - "4222:4222"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/data/jetstream
      - ./etc/nats/:/config
# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
